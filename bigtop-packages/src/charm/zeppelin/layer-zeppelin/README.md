# Overview

Apache Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics.
It allows for beautiful data-driven, interactive, and collaborative documents
with SQL, Scala and more. Learn more at [zeppelin.apache.org][].

This charm deploys version 0.7.0 of the Zeppelin component from
[Apache Bigtop][].

[zeppelin.apache.org]: http://zeppelin.apache.org/
[Apache Bigtop]: http://bigtop.apache.org/


# Deploying

This charm requires Juju 2.0 or greater. If Juju is not yet set up, please
follow the [getting-started][] instructions prior to deploying this charm.

This charm is intended to be deployed via one of the [apache bigtop bundles][].
For example:

    juju deploy hadoop-processing

This will deploy an Apache Bigtop Hadoop cluster. More information about this
deployment can be found in the [bundle readme](https://jujucharms.com/hadoop-processing/).

Now add Zeppelin and relate it to the cluster via the hadoop-plugin:

    juju deploy zeppelin
    juju add-relation zeppelin plugin

To access the web console, find the `PUBLIC-ADDRESS` of the
zeppelin application and expose it:

    juju status zeppelin
    juju expose zeppelin

The web interface will be available at the following URL:

    http://ZEPPELIN_PUBLIC_IP:9080

## Network-Restricted Environments
Charms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy
in this environment, configure a Juju model with appropriate proxy and/or
mirror options. See [Configuring Models][] for more information.

# Verifying

## Status
Apache Bigtop charms provide extended status reporting to indicate when they
are ready:

    juju status

This is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going
progress of the deployment:

    watch -n 2 juju status

The message column will provide information about a given unit's state.
This charm is ready for use once the status message indicates that it is
ready.

## Smoke Test
This charm provides a `smoke-test` action that can be used to verify the
application is functioning as expected. Run the action as follows:

    juju run-action zeppelin/0 smoke-test

Watch the progress of the smoke test actions with:

    watch -n 2 juju show-action-status

Eventually, the action should settle to `status: completed`.  If it
reports `status: failed`, the application is not working as expected. Get
more information about a specific smoke test with:

    juju show-action-output <action-id>


# Issues

Apache Bigtop tracks issues using JIRA (Apache account required). File an
issue for this charm at:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa

Ensure `Bigtop` is selected as the project. Typically, charm issues are filed
in the `deployment` component with the latest stable release selected as the
affected version. Any uncertain fields may be left blank.
